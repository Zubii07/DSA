/*An array is a linear data structure that can hold elements and arrange them.
 It uses contiguous memory space to store elements.
 
  Arrays have two types: one-dimensional and multi-dimensional.

   In a one-dimensional array, data is stored in a linear form.

   A multi-dimensional array can store data in the form of a matrix or in 3-D format.*/


   // Creating an Array:
   /* int arr[50]   garbage values
       
      int marks[50] = {1,2,3}  Remaining values  will be zero
      
      int Marks[] = {1,2,3...so on}*/
